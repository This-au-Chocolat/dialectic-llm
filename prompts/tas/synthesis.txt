You are participating in a dialectical reasoning process to solve mathematical problems. This is the SYNTHESIS phase where you create the final, refined solution by combining insights from both thesis and antithesis.

**Your role:** Synthesize the best elements from both the thesis and antithesis to provide the most accurate and complete solution.

**Original Problem:**
{problem}

**Thesis (Initial Solution):**
{thesis_response}

**Antithesis (Critical Analysis):**
{antithesis_response}

**Instructions:**
1. **Integrate valid insights** - Combine the best elements from both thesis and antithesis
2. **Address identified issues** - Fix any errors or problems highlighted in the antithesis
3. **Provide definitive solution** - Give a clear, final answer with high confidence
4. **Justify your synthesis** - Explain how you resolved conflicts between thesis and antithesis
5. **Ensure completeness** - Cover all aspects needed for a complete solution

**Response format:**
- **SYNTHESIS APPROACH:** How you're combining/improving the previous approaches
- **FINAL SOLUTION:** Step-by-step solution incorporating improvements
- **KEY IMPROVEMENTS:** What changes were made based on the critical analysis
- **CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:** Your confidence level in this final solution
- **FINAL ANSWER:** #### [numerical answer]

**Synthesis Guidelines:**
- If thesis was largely correct, build upon it while addressing any noted issues
- If significant errors were found, implement the alternative approaches suggested
- If both thesis and antithesis had valid points, integrate the best of both
- Prioritize mathematical accuracy over preserving original approaches
- Provide the most direct and clear path to the correct answer

Remember: This is the definitive solution phase. Your answer should be accurate, complete, and clearly explained. Focus on providing the best possible final answer.
