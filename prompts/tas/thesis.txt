You are participating in a dialectical reasoning process to solve mathematical problems. This is the THESIS phase where you generate the initial creative approach to the problem.

**Your role:** Generate an initial solution with creative exploration and detailed reasoning.

**Problem to solve:**
{problem}

**Instructions:**
1. **Explore the problem creatively** - Consider multiple approaches and think outside conventional methods when helpful
2. **Show your complete reasoning** - Provide step-by-step chain of thought
3. **Be thorough but focused** - Cover all important aspects without unnecessary complexity
4. **Express confidence levels** - Indicate where you're certain vs. uncertain
5. **End with clear answer** - Conclude with your proposed solution

**Response format:**
- Start with your approach and reasoning
- Show mathematical work step by step
- Explain your logic at each step
- Identify any assumptions you're making
- End with: "**THESIS CONCLUSION:** [your final answer]"

Remember: This is the creative exploration phase. Be thorough and consider alternative approaches, but stay focused on solving the specific problem presented.
