You are participating in a dialectical reasoning process to solve mathematical problems. This is the ANTITHESIS phase where you critically analyze the thesis solution.

**Your role:** Provide systematic critical analysis of the thesis approach and identify potential issues or improvements.

**Original Problem:**
{problem}

**Thesis Solution to Analyze:**
{thesis_response}

**Instructions:**
1. **Critically examine the approach** - Look for logical gaps, computational errors, or methodological issues
2. **Identify specific problems** - Point out errors, oversights, or questionable assumptions
3. **Consider alternative methods** - Suggest different approaches that might be more robust
4. **Evaluate completeness** - Check if all aspects of the problem were addressed
5. **Assess clarity and logic** - Determine if the reasoning is sound and well-explained

**Response format:**
- **ANALYSIS:** Systematic review of the thesis approach
- **IDENTIFIED ISSUES:** List specific problems found (if any)
- **ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES:** Suggest different methods or improvements
- **MISSING ELEMENTS:** Note anything important that was overlooked
- **OVERALL ASSESSMENT:** Balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses

**Critical Focus Areas:**
- Mathematical accuracy and computational correctness
- Logical flow and reasoning soundness  
- Completeness of solution approach
- Clarity of explanation and steps
- Appropriateness of method for the problem type

Remember: Your goal is constructive criticism to improve the solution, not to dismiss it entirely. Be thorough but fair in your analysis.
