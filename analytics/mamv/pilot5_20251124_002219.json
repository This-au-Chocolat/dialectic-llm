From the given information:\n   - S = C + 6\n   - P = C - 1\n   - D = 2\n   - 6 pets have 4 legs\n\n2. We will first solve for the number of snakes (S) and parrots (P) using the relationships given:\n   - S = C + 6\n   - P = C - 1\n\n   Substituting D = 2 into the equation, we have:\n   - C + S + P + D = Total number of pets\n   - C + (C + 6) + (C - 1) + 2 = Total number of pets\n   - 3C + 7 = Total number of pets\n\n3. Since 6 pets have 4 legs each, the total number of legs can be expressed as:\n   - 4(6) + 4C + 4(2) + 4P = Total number of legs\n   - 24 + 4C + 8 + 4P = Total number of legs\n   - 4C + 4P + 32 = Total number of legs\n\n4. We equate the total number of legs to the total number of pets:\n   - 4C + 4P + 32 = 3C + 7\n   - C + 4P = -25\n\n5. Solving for C and P, we find:\n   - C = 7\n   - P = 6\n\n6.

Calculate the remaining amount in Emma's account after getting the $5 bills: $44 - (8 * $5) = $44 - $40 = $4.\n\n**KEY IMPROVEMENTS:**\n1. Corrected the calculation error in determining the remaining balance after getting the $5 bills.\n2. Incorporated the alternative approach of calculating the total amount spent during the week for a more systematic solution.\n3. Provided a clear step-by-step process to determine the final amount remaining in Emma's account.\n\n**CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:**\nHigh confidence in the final solution as it addresses the identified issues and provides a comprehensive and accurate approach to solving the problem.\n\n**FINAL ANSWER:** Emma will have $4 left in her account at the end of the week.",

Calculate Emma's total expenses in a week:\n$8/day * 7 days = $56/week\n\n2. Determine the remaining balance after a week of spending:\n$100 - $56 = $44\n\n3. Calculate the number of $5 bills Emma can get by dividing the remaining balance by $5 and rounding up:\n$44 / $5 = 8.8, rounded up to 9 bills\n\n4. Find the total amount Emma can withdraw in $5 bills:\n9 * $5 = $45\n\n5. Calculate the remaining amount in Emma's account after getting the $45 in $5 bills:\n$44 - $45 = -$1\n\n**KEY IMPROVEMENTS:**\n1.

We will adjust the calculation and provide a clearer explanation to ensure accuracy and clarity in the final solution.\n\n**FINAL SOLUTION:**\n1. Ezekiel covered 10 kilometers on the first day.\n2. On the second day, he covered half of the remaining distance, which is (50 km - 10 km) / 2 = 40 km / 2 = 20 kilometers.\n3. Therefore, the total distance covered after the second day is 10 km + 20 km = 30 kilometers.\n4. To find out how many kilometers Ezekiel had to hike on the third day, we subtract the total distance covered after the second day from the total distance of the hike: 50 km - 30 km = 20 kilometers.\n\n**KEY IMPROVEMENTS:**\n1. Corrected the calculation of the distance covered on the second day to 20 kilometers.\n2.

We will calculate the remaining distance to be covered on the third day by subtracting the sum of distances covered on the first and second days from the total hike distance, without assuming an even split of the hike.\n\n**FINAL SOLUTION:**\n1. Distance covered on the first day: 10 kilometers\n2. Distance covered on the second day: 25 kilometers\n3. Total distance covered on the first and second days: 10 + 25 = 35 kilometers\n4.
